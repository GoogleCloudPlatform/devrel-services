Install VMWare tools daemon.

  - you should be able to do this from the vSphere UI, but I got errors with Mojave.
  - backup plan: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?productId=742&downloadGroup=VMTOOLS1032
    and then copy the darwin.iso to the host and install it manually.
  - open security preferences and click "Allow" on blocked software install from VMware
  - reboot
  - make sure you can run and see:

    $ /Library/Application Support/VMware Tools/vmware-tools-daemon --cmd "info-get guestinfo.name"
    No value value

Add $HOME/go1.4

System Preferences > Software Update > off

System Preferences > Desktop & Screensaver > never screensaver

Create executable $HOME/stage0.sh with:

   #!/bin/bash
   while true; do (curl -v http://10.50.0.2:8713/stage0/$(sw_ver -productVersion) | sh); sleep 5; done

Automator:

    File > New > Application
    [+] Run shell script
    [ open -a Terminal.app $HOME/stage0.sh ]
    Save to desktop as "run-builder"

System Preferences > Users & Groups > auto-login "gopher" user, run Desktop/run-builder (automator app)

passwordless sudo:

   sudo visudo
   Change line from:
    %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL
   to:
    %admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

install xcode
  (as of 10.10 or 10.9, running git first time will propt for install;
   before that, need to find old xcode version)

verbose boot: (text instead of apple image)

    sudo nvram boot-args="-v"

run-builder-darwin-10_11.sh
