# golang.org/x/build/dashboard

Package dashboard contains shared configuration and logic used by various pieces of the Go continuous build system.

## Deploying

When adding or removing builders, or changing a builder's build policy
(which repos/branches get tested), you need to deploy the
`x/build/cmd/coordinator` binary. Additionally, you usually want to
re-deploy the `x/build/app/appengine` code to update
https://build.golang.org/. The latter is only for humans (forcing
columns to show up and adding the little black dots on cells that
aren't built), but doesn't affect what gets built.
