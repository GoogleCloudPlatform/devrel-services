# Overview

Go's Mac builders run at Mac hosting provider,
[MacStadium](https://macstadium.com). We have a VMware cluster with 10
physical Mac Minis on which we run two VMs each.

In addition to 20 Mac VMs, we also run one 1 Linux VM that's our
bastion host & runs various services.

## Bastion Host

The bastion host is **macstadiumd.golang.org** and can be accessed
via:

    $ ssh -i ~/keys/id_ed25519_golang1 gopher@macstadiumd.golang.org

(Where `id_ed255519_golang` is available from http://go/go-builders-ssh)

It also runs:

* a DHCP server for the 20 Mac VMs to get IP addresses from (systemd
  unit `isc-dhcp-server.service`, so watch with `journalctl -f -u
  isc-dhcp-server.service`)

* the [**makemac** daemon](../../../cmd/makemac/) daemon (systemd
  unit `makemac.service`, so watch with `journalctl -f -u makemac`).
  This monitors the build coordinator (farmer.golang.org) as well as
  the VMware cluster (via the [`govc` CLI
  tool](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc)) and makes
  and destroys Mac VMs as needed. It also serves plaintext HTTP status
  at http://macstadiumd.golang.org:8713 which used to be accessible in
  a browser, but recent HSTS configuration on `*.golang.org` means you
  need to use curl now. But that's a good way to see what it's doing
  remotely, without authentication.

* [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) listening on port 51820,
  because OpenVPN + Mac's built-in VPN client is painful and buggy.
  See config in `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`. This doesn't yet come up on
  boot. It's a recent addition.

## OpenVPN

The method of last resort to access the cluster, which works even if
the bastion host VM is down, is to VPN to our Cisco something gateway.

TODO: put this info somewhere. It's currently circulated in email
between Brad, Russ, and Dmitri in an email with some subject "macOS VM
info".

## VMware web UI

Once you've connected to either OpenVPN or WireGuard, you can hit the
VMware web UI at:

   https://10.88.203.9/ui/

(Alternatively, `ssh -D` to the bastion host to make a SOCKS tunnel
and configure your browser to send proxy through that SOCKS tunnel.)

## Debugging

Common techniques to debug:

* Can you get to the bastion host?

* What does `journalctl -f -u makemac` say? Is it error looping?

* Look at https://10.88.203.9/ui/ and see if VMware is unhappy about
  things. Did hosts die? Did storage disappear?

* Need to hard reboot machines? Eventually we'll fix
  https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32033 but for now you can use
  https://portal.macstadium.com/subscriptions and power cycle
  machines that VMware reports dead (or that you see missing from
  https://farmer.golang.org's reverse pool info).
